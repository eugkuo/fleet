* Ensure details for a software installation run are available and accurate even after the corresponding installer has been edited or deleted

NOTE: The database migration included with this feature does _not_ use activity data to backfill existing installs, due to the lack of indexes on that table.

To backfill install data from activities (which will be more comprehensive and accurate than the migration default, which only populates from installers), run this database query:

```sql
UPDATE host_software_installs i
JOIN activities a ON a.activity_type = 'installed_software'
	AND i.execution_id = a.details->>"$.install_uuid"
SET i.software_title_name = COALESCE(a.details->>"$.software_title", i.software_title_name),
	i.installer_filename = COALESCE(a.details->>"$.software_package", i.installer_filename),
	i.updated_at = i.updated_at
```
